use unordered map first always as it taked o(1) tc to store and fetch and map takes o(logn) as it sorts the elements too however,
if unordered map gives tle use map,unordered map will fail in case of collision.

before we understand the collision we need to understand division method
division method
[2,5,26,139] we cant make array of size >10 and need to use array hashing
then we modulo each no with 10
collision happens when each number ends up to similar hash place for eg[18,78,...1008] and every one them end at 8
now it takes o(n) for unordered_map
